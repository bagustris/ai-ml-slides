# What is Artificial Intelligence?

**Artificial Intelligence** is an exciting scientific discipline that studies how we can make computers exhibit intelligent behavior.

- Computers operate on algorithms - well-defined procedures
- Some tasks cannot be explicitly programmed
- Example: Determining age from a photograph

> We cannot explicitly explain how we determine age, nor can we program a computer to do it traditionally.

# Weak AI vs. Strong AI

## Weak AI (Narrow AI)
- Designed for specific tasks
- Examples: Siri, Alexa, recommendation algorithms
- Highly specialized, lacks general intelligence

## Strong AI (AGI)
- Human-level intelligence and understanding
- Can perform any intellectual task
- Currently theoretical - not yet achieved

---

# Defining Intelligence

- No clear universal definition exists
- Connected to abstract thinking and self-awareness
- Difficult to measure objectively

> Question: Is a cat intelligent? Different people give different answers!

# The Turing Test

Proposed by Alan Turing as a test for machine intelligence:

- Compares system to human intelligence
- Human interrogator conducts text-based dialogue
- If interrogator cannot distinguish machine from human, system is considered intelligent

**Eugene Goostman** (2014):
- Convinced 30% of judges it was human
- Posed as 13-year-old Ukrainian boy
- Demonstrated cleverness, not true intelligence

# Two Main Approaches to AI

## Top-down Approach (Symbolic Reasoning)
- Models human reasoning processes
- Extracts knowledge from experts
- Represents knowledge in computer-readable form
- Uses explicit rules and logic

## Bottom-up Approach (Neural Networks)
- Models structure of human brain
- Uses interconnected neurons
- Learns from training data
- Similar to how babies learn

---

# Other Approaches

**Emergent/Synergetic Approach:**
- Complex behavior from simple agent interactions
- Intelligence emerges from reactive behaviors

**Evolutionary Approach:**
- Optimization based on evolution principles
- Genetic algorithms

# Brief History of AI

![Brief History of AI](images/history-of-ai.png)

- **1950s-1960s:** Birth of AI, symbolic reasoning dominates
- **1970s:** AI Winter - expert systems too expensive
- **2010s:** Neural networks rise with big data
- **Today:** AI mostly synonymous with neural networks

---

# Evolution: Chess Programs

**Early Programs:**
- Search-based algorithms
- Alpha-beta pruning

**Middle Era:**
- Case-based reasoning
- Learning from human matches

**Modern Programs:**
- Neural networks
- Reinforcement learning
- Self-play and learning from mistakes

# Evolution: Conversational AI

![The Turing test's evolution](images/turing-test-evol.png)

**Early:** ELIZA - simple grammatical rules

**Current:** Cortana, Siri, Google Assistant - hybrid systems

**Future:** Complete neural-based models (GPT, Turing-NLG)

# Recent AI Research (2012-2020)

![ILSVRC Accuracy](images/ilsvrc.gif)

**2012:** Convolutional Neural Networks revolutionize image classification

**ImageNet Challenge:**
- Error rates dropped from 30% to 16.4%
- 2015: Human-level accuracy achieved
